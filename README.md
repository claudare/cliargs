# cliargs

A declarative way to parse command line arguments in zig.

The api is inspired by `*std.Build` pattern `b.option(comptime T: type, name_raw: []const u8, description_raw: []const u8)`.
Golangs standard library `flag` is also another inspiration.

# WIP

This is work in progress. This library is not complete and there are still lots of "trash" files from previous attempts at implementing this.
